E-COMMERCE WEBSITE PROJECT - PROMPTS DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================
Project: Full-Stack E-Commerce Website
Tech Stack: Next.js, Express.js, MongoDB Atlas, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
Generated: November 2025
================================================================================

PHASE 1: ARCHITECTURE & PLANNING
================================================================================

Prompt 1.1 - Technical Architecture Document
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Act as a Senior Full-Stack Architect. Create a comprehensive technical 
architecture document for an E-Commerce website based on the following 
requirements:

**Core Functionalities:**
1. **Product Browsing:** Users can view a list of products.
2. **Product Details:** Users can click on a product to see its detailed 
   information.
3. **Shopping Cart:** Users can add/remove products and adjust quantities in a 
   cart that persists across page refreshes.

**Tech Stack Mandate:**
- Frontend: React.js (or Next.js) with React Router.
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js.
- Database: MongoDB Atlas.

**Architecture Document Requirements:**
- **System Overview:** A high-level diagram (describe it in text/mermaid.js 
  format) showing the interaction between Frontend, Backend, and Database.
- **Detailed Component Breakdown:**
    - **Frontend Components:** List the key React components (e.g., 
      `ProductList`, `ProductDetail`, `ShoppingCart`, `Navbar`) and their 
      responsibilities.
    - **Backend API Endpoints:** Define the necessary RESTful API endpoints 
      (e.g., `GET /api/products`, `GET /api/products/:id`). Specify the HTTP 
      method, URL, and purpose for each.
    - **Data Models:** Define the schema for the "Product" and "Cart" (or 
      "Order") models in a MongoDB-friendly format (using Mongoose schemas).
- **Project Folder Structure:** Provide a detailed folder structure for a 
  monorepo containing both `frontend` and `backend` directories.
- **State Management Strategy:** Explain how the shopping cart state will be 
  managed in the React frontend (e.g., using React Context API or a lightweight 
  state library).


================================================================================
PHASE 2: BACKEND DEVELOPMENT
================================================================================

Prompt 2.1 - Backend Scaffolding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Act as a Senior Backend Developer. Using the architecture document as a guide, 
write the initial code for the Node.js/Express backend.

**Specific Tasks:**
1. Create the main server file (e.g., `server.js` or `index.js`).
2. Set up essential middleware (Express.json(), CORS).
3. Include code to connect to a MongoDB Atlas database using Mongoose. Use a 
   configuration file for the connection string.
4. Define the Mongoose schemas and models for "Product" and "Cart". The Cart 
   should be able to hold an array of items, where each item references a 
   Product and has a quantity.
5. Create a placeholder route handler for `GET /api/products` that returns a 
   simple JSON message for now.

Please provide the complete code for all the necessary files as per the folder 
structure defined in the architecture.


Prompt 2.2 - REST API Implementation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Act as a Senior Backend Developer. Now, implement the complete REST API 
endpoints for the E-Commerce backend as defined in the architecture.

**Endpoints to Implement:**
- `GET /api/products`: Fetches and returns an array of all products from the 
  database.
- `GET /api/products/:id`: Fetches and returns the details of a single product 
  by its ID.
- `GET /api/cart`: Fetches the current shopping cart. (For now, we can work 
  with a single, session-less cart. In a real app, this would be tied to a 
  user session).
- `POST /api/cart`: Adds an item to the cart. The request body should contain 
  `productId` and `quantity`. If the item exists, update the quantity.
- `PUT /api/cart/:productId`: Updates the quantity of a specific item in the 
  cart.
- `DELETE /api/cart/:productId`: Removes an item from the cart.

**Instructions:**
- Use the Product and Cart models you defined earlier.
- For the cart, since we don't have user authentication, you can simulate a 
  cart by using a single cart document with a fixed ID (e.g., "defaultCart"). 
  In a future step, we can move this to the browser's local storage or 
  implement proper sessions.
- Include proper error handling (e.g., 404 if product not found, 400 for bad 
  requests).
- Write clean, commented code.


================================================================================
PHASE 3: FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT
================================================================================

Prompt 3.1 - Frontend Scaffolding
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Act as a Senior Frontend Developer. Using the architecture document as a guide, 
scaffold the React.js frontend application.

**Specific Tasks:**
1. Create the main `App.js` file that sets up React Router with the following 
   routes:
    - `/` -> HomePage/ProductList page
    - `/product/:id` -> ProductDetail page
    - `/cart` -> ShoppingCart page
2. Create the basic shell (functional component with placeholder JSX) for each 
   of the following components: `ProductList`, `ProductDetail`, `ShoppingCart`, 
   and `Navbar`. The Navbar should include a link to the Home page and the Cart 
   page, as well as display the current number of items in the cart.
3. Set up the Context API for global state management of the shopping cart. 
   Create a `CartContext.js` file. The context should provide:
    - `cartItems` (state)
    - Functions: `addToCart`, `removeFromCart`, `updateQuantity`, `getCartTotal` 
      (a function to calculate the total number of items for the Navbar).
4. Wrap the `App` component with the `CartProvider`.

Please provide the complete code for all the necessary files.


Prompt 3.2 - Core UI Implementation & API Integration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Act as a Senior Frontend Developer. Now, implement the core UI components to 
fetch and display data from the backend API.

**Tasks for `ProductList` Component:**
- Use the `fetch` API or `axios` to call `GET /api/products` from your backend 
  when the component mounts.
- Display the list of products in a grid. Each product card should show at 
  least the name, image, price, and a "Add to Cart" button.
- Clicking on a product card should navigate the user to the `/product/:id` 
  route.

**Tasks for `ProductDetail` Component:**
- Use the `productId` from the URL parameter (use `useParams` from React 
  Router).
- Fetch the product details by calling `GET /api/products/:id`.
- Display all product information (name, image, price, description, etc.).
- Include an "Add to Cart" button that uses the `addToCart` function from the 
  `CartContext`.

Ensure all components handle loading and error states gracefully.


Prompt 3.3 - Shopping Cart Finalization
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Act as a Senior Frontend Developer. Finalize the shopping cart functionality.

**Tasks for `ShoppingCart` Component:**
- Use the `cartItems` from the `CartContext`.
- Display each item in the cart with its image, name, price, and a quantity 
  selector.
- The quantity selector should allow the user to increase/decrease the quantity 
  (calling `updateQuantity` from context) or remove the item entirely (calling 
  `removeFromCart`).
- Display the subtotal for each item and the grand total for the entire cart.
- Include a "Proceed to Checkout" button (it can be a placeholder for now).

**Enhance State Persistence:**
- Modify the `CartContext` to initialize its state from the browser's 
  `localStorage` on load.
- Update `localStorage` whenever the `cartItems` state changes. This will make 
  the cart persist across page refreshes.

Please provide the updated code for the `CartContext.js` and the new 
`ShoppingCart.js` component.


================================================================================
PHASE 4: STYLING & UI/UX
================================================================================

Prompt 4.1 - Modern Responsive Styling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Act as a Senior UI/UX Developer. Apply modern, responsive CSS styling to the 
entire E-Commerce website. The goal is a clean and professional look.

**Requirements:**
- Use a mobile-first approach with CSS Flexbox/Grid.
- Ensure the product grid and navigation bar are fully responsive.
- Style the product cards, buttons, and cart items to be visually appealing.
- Use a consistent color scheme and typography.
- You can use a lightweight CSS framework like Tailwind CSS OR write custom 
  CSS. Please specify which you are using.

Apply the styles directly to the components or provide a separate CSS file, 
ensuring all elements are styled.
